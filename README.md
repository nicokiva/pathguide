# pathguide
Indoors Location Android app.
Pathguide guides users from initial to final point (similar to GPS) using flags (BLE devices).
The app is optimized to blind people, or visibility reduced, who selects the destination and the app reproduces the instructions to reach the final point. After the user selects the destination, the app calculates the best way to reach it. The app will reproduce instructions to reach the flags until the destination is reached. Immediately a checkpoint is reached, the map is recalculated in case it changed.

Stack/devices:
- Java for Android apps.
- Bluetooth Low Energy devices used to be detected by the app as the checkpoint.
